        <h3>What is WebDAV?</h3>

        <p>WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring Versioning) allows users to manipulate files on WWW servers directly from your computer to be published on the internet. WebDAV is separated into either class 1 or class 2. Class 1 is associated with editing, moving, creating, or deleting files and/or folders. Class 2 has the oppposite function, which can lock files and folders to prevent users from making any type of modifications to them.</p>
        <p>WebDAV has both it's benefits as well as disadvangtages. In the following sections, we will explore more about both sides. </p>
